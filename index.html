      <h2>Strengthening Institutions Where Trust Matters Most</h2>
      <p>
        VGA Consulting is a governance and assurance advisory firm serving boards,
        leaders, and oversight bodies in Kenya and beyond. We help institutions
        uncover hidden risks, strengthen governance and assurance systems, and
        translate institutional insight into accountable action.
      </p>
      <p>
        In compliance-heavy environments where trust is fragile and accountability
        is often procedural, we guide institutions from formality toward credibility,
        durability, and real institutional strength.

      <h2>About VGA Consulting</h2>

      <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
      <p>
        Institutions shape economies, public confidence, and social wellbeing.
        Yet many struggle with weak governance, fragmented accountability, and
        assurance processes that emphasize compliance over substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        VGA Consulting exists to bridge this gap. We prioritize depth over speed,
        judgment over ritual, and long-term value over short-term fixes.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        We listen to the quiet truths within institutions and transform them into
        insights that create, protect, and sustain value for a more accountable future.
      </p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p><strong>Trusted institutions. Sustained value. A more accountable future.</strong></p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To work with boards, leaders, and oversight bodies to surface hidden risks,
        strengthen governance and assurance systems, and translate insight into
        accountable action.
